A rather minimal and unorganized collection of my life :).

Currently developing an EMR system and exploring cloud computing @ [Teknertia](https://www.teknertia.com). Previously worked on creating better workflow for business teams @ [Arc Resources](https://www.arcresources.com/) and [TC Energy](https://www.tcenergy.com/).

Also working on:
- [[projects/harmonia|harmonia]]
- [[projects/twilight|twilight]]

Things I have made:
 - my vscode theme, [momentum-vscode](/projects/momentum)
 - [ctrl-web](/projects/ctrlweb) for all the lazy devs who google a lot
 - a distributed recreation of r/place, [[projects/canva|canvas]]
 - [See all projects ->](/projects)

An adventurous [coffee brewer](/writings/expresso), [keyboard enthusiast](/writings/keebs), wannabe [photographer](/photography/home) and 'avid' [reader](/reading).
